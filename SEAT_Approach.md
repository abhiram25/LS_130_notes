In larger projects, there are 4 steps to writing a test.

1. Set up the necessary objects
2. Execute the code against the object we're testing
3. Assert the results of the execution
4. Tear down and clean up any lingering effects

```
require 'minitest/autorun'

require_relative 'car'

class CarTest < MiniTest::Test

  def test_car_exists
    car = Car.new
    assert(car)
  end

  def test_wheels
    car = Car.new
    assert_equal(4, car.wheels)
  end

  def test_name_is_nil
    car = Car.new
    assert_nil(car.name)
  end

  def test_raise_initialize_with_arg
    assert_raises(ArgumentError) do
      car = Car.new(name: "Joey")
    end
  end

  def assert_instance_of_car
    car = Car.new
    assert_instance_of(Car, car)
  end

  def test_includes_car
    car = Car.new
    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    arr << car

    assert_includes(arr, car)
  end
end
```

All the tests pass.  Do you notice all the tests have `car = Car.new`

Instead of repeatedly writing this out, this should be extracted to some `setup` that gets executed before the running of every test.

Great news, we can use the `setup` instance method to do this.

```
require 'minitest/autorun'

require_relative 'car'

class CarTest < MiniTest::Test
  def setup
    @car = Car.new
  end

  def test_car_exists
    car = Car.new
    assert(@car)
  end

  def test_wheels
    assert_equal(4, @car.wheels)
  end

  def test_name_is_nil
    assert_nil(@car.name)
  end

  def test_raise_initialize_with_arg
    assert_raises(ArgumentError) do
      car = Car.new(name: "Joey")
    end
  end

  def assert_instance_of_car
    assert_instance_of(Car, @car)
  end

  def test_includes_car
    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    arr << @car

    assert_includes(arr, @car)
  end
end
```
